Anki One Click features automatic flashcard creation for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a free application designed to help you retain knowledge. This feature requires the prior installation of an Anki plugin called [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159). Check the respective project page for more information about how to set up this software.

Current version of Anki One Click uses [Yandex Dictionary API](https://yandex.com/dev/dictionary/) for word translation. So you have to create [Yandex Dictionary API Key](https://yandex.com/dev/dictionary/keys/get/) and specify this key in Anki One Click options page to allow the extension to translate words.
